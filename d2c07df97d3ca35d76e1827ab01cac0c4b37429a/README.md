# Introduction

As a User Experience Researcher, I have worked with development and business teams on shared products. I have led multiple streams of exploratory, concept, and evaluative user research and established research practices, processes, and metrics.

I became a User Researcher after studying Applied Anthropology and Human-Computer interaction, because I am fascinated with how people think and understand processes and the relationship between social and technological trends. I am a natural user researcher because I am trained as an anthropologist to observe and to listen to people. My strength is my ability to present research insights in an engaging form.

When I am not working, I bike, spend time with family and read UX and Anthropology books.
