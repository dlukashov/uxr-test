# Partnerships with other teams - Closing the gaps

## Situation 

UXR conducts mostly usability research, but only a couple product teams engage UXR in their product development. Other departments express curiosity about user research, and informally discuss possible collaborations, but do not proceed with filling out research requests.

## Goal

Understand if other teams know how to incorporate UXR research in their work. Encourage and develop early collaboration with UXR to prevent redesigns.

## Actions

 - Worked with development and engineering teams to collect needs and perceptions. 
 - Created an affinity diagram to map company knowledge about UXR and identify gaps in understanding about applying and acting on UXR results. 
 - Presented a UXR action plan that included 
   - regularly presenting successful research examples at company-wide meetings 
   - leading a series of 30 minute workshops tailored for each departmentâ€™s needs 
   - experimenting with UXR open office hours
   - and simplifying the UXR request form. 

## Results

 - UXR received and fulfilled at least one research request from each department. 
 - Researchers are invited to departmental product meetings. 
 - Several researchers are embedded within six different departments on a rotational basis.
